# **👕 FuturaFit – Smart Closet Organization**  

## **📌 Overview**  
FuturaFit is an **AI-powered smart wardrobe application** designed to help users efficiently manage their clothing collections. By leveraging **image recognition, machine learning (ResNet50), and a Flask-based backend**, the system categorizes outfits into predefined groups like **tops, jeans, and frocks**.  

The application enhances user experience by offering features such as:  
✅ **Automated outfit categorization** based on image recognition  
✅ **Seamless image upload & processing** for wardrobe organization  
✅ **Smart recommendations for outfit planning** (future enhancement)  
✅ **Scalable and responsive design** for a smooth user experience

## **🔍 Code Example (Flask API for Image Upload & Categorization)**  

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template
import cv2
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load pre-trained ResNet50 model
model = tf.keras.applications.ResNet50(weights="imagenet")

def preprocess_image(image_path):
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    image = cv2.resize(image, (224, 224))  # Resize for ResNet50
    image = np.expand_dims(image, axis=0)
    return image

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def index():
    if request.method == "POST":
        file = request.files["file"]
        file.save("uploads/" + file.filename)
        img = preprocess_image("uploads/" + file.filename)
        prediction = model.predict(img)
        return f"Predicted Category: {np.argmax(prediction)}"
    
    return render_template("index.html")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```
